# RESTAURANT 2.0. - CHALLENGE

[The first challenge](https://github.com/arnoldhaub/restaurant-css-framework) was to make a website for a restaurant using Bootstrap framework.

The new challenge is to use that project by adding PHP to manage the website through a admin page.

- **Type of challenge:** learning
- **Duration:** 5 days
- **Team challenge:** solo

## Learning objectives

At the end of this challenge, depending on what you completed, you should be able to:

- Make a Form and manage messages via an interface
- View and manage a guestbook
- Display an image gallery dynamically
- Use an API
- Deploy a project in php

## The mission

Once upon a time you made a website for a restaurant franchise. Now and after hearing about the wonderful work you did the owner is calling you back to implement new features and improve the website.

Sadly, he can only pay you for a week of work, which won’t be enough time to implement all his ideas. Hopefully, he’s ready to make compromises, you have to implement as much as you can in the given time.
